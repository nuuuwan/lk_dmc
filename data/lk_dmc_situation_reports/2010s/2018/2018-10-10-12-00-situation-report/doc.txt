CURRENT SITUATION

As per the Department of Meteorology, few places in Galle Kalutara, Colombo & Gampaha districts have received high rainfall. As of 7th October at 8.30hrs received highest rainfalls are Galle 334.1mm, Padukka 186mm, Colombo Fort 109.3mm, Kirindiwela 89.2mm.

As of today, approximately, 2,641 families have been evacuated into 28 welfare centres in 6 Districts due to flood and landslide risks. As of now 11 deaths were reported to the Disaster Management Centre.

Two Tropical storms persisted in Arabian Sea and Bay of Bengal are moving away from the country and re-duction of rainfall is expected from today onwards. However there is a possibility of rainfall in Southern, South-western and Sabaragamu areas and also in eastern, north central areas during next 48 hours.

Department of Meteorology reported last 24 hours rainfall observed in main stations ended on morning hours of 10 October 2018 showing reduction of rainfall in many areas; in Anuradhapura 23mm, Katunayaka 35mm, Mahailuppallama 26.7mm and Vavuniya 14.2mm. The highest rainfall recorded was around 84.3mm in Warakapola in Kegalle District. However, based on received rainfall since 8th October 2018, rainfall has been reduced in catchment areas and affected areas and flood waters are receding, allowing response and relief services to be more effective.

Landslide watch is still effective Kalutara, Galle and Badulla Districts.

The EOC of the DMC has coordinated with Military agencies and Police to mobilize troops for response ac-tions. So far 19 officers, 650 soldiers with response equipment are mobilized in three districts to support ground efforts. Further, 50 officers and 1,275 soldiers are standby for required deployments.

Cooked meals have been given by divisional administration with the support of DMC?NDRSC and military personnel for all displaced people in 4 Districts.

Over 1,000 people have been evacuated to safe areas by military troops in Galle and Kalutara Districts. De-bris due to flood water has been cleared by response personnel in Biyagama, Palindanuwara, Ingiriya, Wakwella, Agaliya, Walallawita divisional areas.

Rain water blockage was cleared in Nagalagam street area due to establishment of salt water de-intrusion dyke by the SLRDCC. The Ministry has immediately requested to take action to mitigate this issue to reduce impact of heavy rains.

Response Actions

5

As a result of Tropical Cyclone “Titly” the heavy rains were oc-curred in South western, Sabaragamu areas over 5-7 October 2018. Since the system moving away from Sri Lankan east coast the effect is slowly fading out as of today. However sudden in-crease of rain and winds are still potential and considerable rain-fall received to Uva areas.

The effects of Tropical cyclone “Luban” in the Arabian sea has been moved from western coast of the country and no more major influence to the weather in Sri Lanka. The inter-monsoon has been establishes over the country now and today onward evening showers are expected.
